## Evaluation Metrics
### Metric 1
**Name:** Accuracy

**Choice Justification:** 
I chose accuracy as a fairly obvious metric for a classification model. We want
an objective success rate for how good the model is, and accuracy provides that entirely.

### Metric 2
**Name:** Precision

**Choice Justification:** 
Higher precision minimizes false positives, which is an important metric for ensuring that
we don't flag innocent subjects for misinformation.
