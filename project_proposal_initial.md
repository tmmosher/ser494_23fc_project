Keywords: Misinformation, fake news, dead internet
Description: In this project, I plan to analyze data sets with user data related to sharing factual misinformation on a variety of websites, including (but not limited to) YouTube, ~~Twitter~~ X, and Instagram. Further, I would like to anaylze which demographics are most likely to use certain social media platforms as a news outlet. Questions I would like to ask include, "Who is most at risk of sharing internet misinformation?" and "Have improved AI models over the last two years caused an increase in the total amount of misinformation shared online?". 
Intellectual Merit: I chiefly want to find out who is the most at risk of falling victim to online misinformation. While it may be nice to assume it's simply old people who are out of touch with modern technology, many peers my age (including myself) have fallen victim to misinformation, even if innocuous. Further, I think it would be interesting to see if there's even a difference at all between age groups / sex, or if the naturally trusting nature of most human interaction leads to a pretty stable output across the board. 
Data Sourcing: I have found a dataset that has demographic data for YouTube users who shared COVID misinformation content back in 2021, as well as a dataset for viewers of Fox News by age group. I found another dataset that covers Twitter misinformation, though most user data is scrubbed from it. I have not checked with the ASU library to see if they have any recommendations for locating relevant datasets, but I imagine that would be a good resource.
